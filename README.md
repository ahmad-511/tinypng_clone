# How to Build a TinyPNG TinyJPG Clone with Javascript

âœ… [Check out Dave Gray's YouTube Channel with all of his wonderful tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/DaveGrayTeachesCode).

**Description:**

Learn how to build a TinyPNG Clone with Javscript. TinyPNG and TinyJPG are great dev tools for compressing images. In this Javascript project tutorial, we'll use a Serverless Function for image compression. Our clone will actually improve the compression rate!

**Modifications:**
1. Simplify the calculation in `handleFiles` and `getFileSizeString` functions
1. Simplify the IDs used in `createResult` function
1. Remove unnecessary id for p2 in `createResult` function
1. Implementing Upload/Download progress by using `XMLHttpRequest` Object instead of the `fetch` API 


If you have completed Dave's [8 hour JavaScript course tutorial video](https://youtu.be/EfAl9bwzVZk), this is a great additional tutorial to build on those lessons.
